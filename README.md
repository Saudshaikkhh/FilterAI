# FilterAI
This Python script applies 25 image filters to all photos in a specified folder, saving the filtered images in an output folder. Each filter transforms the images in unique ways, such as sharpening, adding noise, or creating artistic effects. The script uses OpenCV for efficient batch image processing and automation.
